Finally, after a very long time, a trip with the OG people happened. 
Planned and booked everything just a few hours before, and we literally went to Coorg.
Started at 5AM and reached Coorg at 10AM. Did zip-lining in Coorg. It was one of the things on my bucket list. But I wanted to do this in a longer way; I will do that one day.
This time we booked GoStops to try the hostel experience. It was really nice :) - had very fun packing, gaming sessions, night talks, roasting each other, fights in between; everything was really memorable
