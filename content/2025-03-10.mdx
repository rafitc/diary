summary: "Left first job after college"

Today was an important day in my life. After 2.9 years with lots of learning, ups and downs I left Neewee, which was my first company after college. The day was filled with mixed emotions. Iâ€™ll miss my friends and colleagues. These guys were really helpful and supportive. Iâ€™ll miss each and every one.
