For the last couple of days, I've been working from home. TBH, now I've started enjoying WFH. When I was in my previous company, WFH was the most stressful time.
But this week, in a new place, it was very chilled working. My day starts with morning tea from random tea shops right after Subhi Namaz. Then I have small fun times with my family, nieces, and neighbours. I go into work mode after breakfast, then have evening tea after Asar namaz. I used to travel 7KM to get tea. 
I have a lot of personal time. I really loved this <3

Tea time.
