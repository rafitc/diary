It was a wonderful weekend with my colleagues at Mysore. I had a good road trip from Bangalore to Mysore. We started early in the morning. I worked from the hostel for the day and roamed around all over Mysore! 
It was full of fun, packed with teasing, food, and scoldings from Shalini, the guy Harshit who cared about his helmet more than anything, a change of plans due to rain. Everything was awesome. Some more memories were added.

Oh. Really, forget that; actually, we came to attend Sreekanth's house-warming ceremony. Had good South Indian Karnatic food at the end!
